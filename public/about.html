<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a detail-oriented administrative professional with a solid background in business administration, finance, and legal operations. Over the years, I’ve supported dynamic teams across industries—from corporate finance to legal practice—by managing processes, streamlining workflows, and ensuring that day-to-day operations run smoothly. I take pride in being reliable, organized, and efficient, always ready to take on new challenges.</p>

<p>My experience includes working as an Admin Assistant and Operations Paralegal at an Australian law firm, where I became proficient in tools like Confluence, ActionStep, Microsoft Office Suite, SAP Business One, and Oracle NetSuite. I also have hands-on experience in CRM software, particularly Keap Max, where I’ve built custom automations and integrated APIs to optimize contact management and streamline workflows. Additionally, I’ve held roles in treasury, finance, and accounting, giving me a strong foundation in both back-end systems and client-facing responsibilities. In parallel, I’m currently expanding my skill set by learning web development—exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to broaden my capabilities and open new career paths.</p>

<p>I value clear communication, continuous learning, and a solutions-focused mindset. Whether I’m improving internal systems, supporting a team, or working with clients, I aim to create a positive impact. I’m excited about combining my administrative expertise, automation skills, and growing tech knowledge to contribute in more innovative, efficient, and meaningful ways.</p>
